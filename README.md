# Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to refactor the function in `getPrice.ts`. The code has consciously been written in a
bad way, your task is to clean it up in a way that you would have liked to find it. However, you should not add, remove
or change the order of the parameters, and the return type should be the same. You should also write tests for the
function in `getPrice.test.ts`.

You should not spend more than 1-2 hours on the assignment. If you feel there are things left that you would have liked
to improve, you can add comments for it in the code, this is completely fine. Is there some special case that the code
doesn't handle? If so, feel free to improve it. Good luck!
